## Unnamed Hacking Themed Game

In this platforming game, you play as the avatar of a hacker invading the cyberspace of some computer system. Numerous defenses are in place to prevent you getting your grubby little digital mits on those precious bits, but you have some unique abilities to help you deal with them and even turn their defenses against each other. 

You are armed with a hacking omnitool - a weapon which in cyberspace can change its shape. Should you strike objects with certain attacks, you'll inject some code into them that may alter their behaviour. Beware, that some things may be ready for your payloads and will react violently to a hacking attempt. 

Fight your way through the system's defenses and explore to get as many bits as you can! You never know where certain chunks of data might be hiding...

## Controls

* W / <- - Left
* D / -> - Right
* Left Mouse - Normal attack

* Forward + Right Mouse - Cyan attack
* Up + Right Mouse - Red Attack
* Down + Right Mouse - Purple Attack

##Hack Effects:
The effects differ from object to object, but otherwise the different hacks have the following general effects: 
* Red hack - Attempts to disable the enemy's means to tell friend from foe. It also makes some objects deadly to enemies.
* Cyan hack - Attempts to turn objects solid.
* Purple hack - Attempts to turn objects non-solid or disables/re-enables them.
* Blue hack - The wild card. The effect differs from object to object.
* Hacks are toggle-able. Simply strike the object with the same hack again to undo the effect. 
* Some objects allow you to stack hacks together.
